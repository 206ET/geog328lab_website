    <h2 class="counted">Cultural Impact</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Michael Jordan</strong> transformed basketball into a global phenomenon — redefining fame,
      sneaker culture, and brand endorsement through iconic achievements such as his perfect 6–0 Finals record 
      and the Air Jordan brand.</p>

      <p><strong>LeBron James</strong> elevated the modern player’s voice — dominating on the court while also
      influencing media, athlete business ventures, and community leadership through projects like the “I Promise School.”</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="counted">Longevity vs. Perfection</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Jordan represents peak dominance: the highest level of play sustained long enough to win every time it mattered most.</p>
      <p>LeBron represents unmatched longevity: elite performance for two decades with no signs of stopping and breaking all-time scoring records.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="counted">The Ongoing Debate</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Ultimately, the GOAT debate revolves around what fans value: winning with perfection, or long-term dominance? 
      Both legends made basketball better and shaped sports across eras. The debate will continue for generations.</p>
